Rules for modules from the list:

`EXCLUDE id = (\1)A where \1 in ids AND modules[\1][value] == module[value]`
`EXCLUDE id = GEOG4(\2) where GEOG3\2 in ids - redirect?`


#PROBLEM:

- No single point source of data on modules at UCL
- All UCL students have the opportunity to take >=1 module outside home dept
- Much information online, when you find it, is out of date or incorrect
- With 3129 UG modules across departments, faculties and schools, centralised data is hard.
- Asking faculty to manually update information is unreasonable.

#SOLUTION:

- Student led venture to collate information
- Level 0 (3129 modules): module code, title, credit value, level.
    + even this information is not available anywhere (except Portico).
- Level 0a (? modules) Level 0 + link to timetable, moodle course, reading list, and 
- Level 1 (320 modules): Level 0 + description
