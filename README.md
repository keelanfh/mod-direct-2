# Module Directory

Aim: a website which acts as a single source of information for every undergraduate module at UCL. At the moment, information is spread across central and departmental websites, is presented illogically, and is often out of date or inaccurate.

## Setup

Required files: `running_list.xlsx`, `boe_natsci.htm` and `boe_sci.htm` (all in `data` directory)

Run `setup.py`

## Start Flask Webserver

1. `export FLASK_APP=application.py`
